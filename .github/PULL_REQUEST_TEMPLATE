## Comprehension Questions

Feature | Feedback
--- | ---
What are the components that make up a method? | signature, parameters, code block, end
What are the advantages of using git when collaboratively working on one code base? | keep track of changes, both people can have access to what they are working on, can merge changes
What kind of relationship did you and your pair have with the unit tests? | one of us is an ask and one of us is an "extreme" guess, but we made it work and we both tried to switch driver/navigator roles, but it is hard for an ask to not grab the computer sometimes -- and hard for the guess to grab it. We have to be aware of e/o differences and the ask can ask the guess if everything is well so far.
Does your code use any methods from the `Enumerable` mixin? If so, where and why was it helpful? | yes we used include?
What was one method you and your pair used to debug code? | we did mostly puts debugging, and we also continuously used the specs file using rake, skipping certain to tests, to see which areas were passing and failing and also used binding.pry
What are two discussion points that you and your pair discussed when giving/receiving feedback from each other that you would be willing to share? | we just shared feedback in the beginning regarding our guess vs ask preferences, in order to work with it from the start
